            <div class='historytitle'>Our History</div>
            <div class ='history'>In 1995, Kalmar started a project called RTCH, or Rough Terrain Container Handler. The objective was to develop and produce machines for the US Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM). The Kalmar Rough Terrain Center (KRTC) was later established in August 1999 and consisted of a one-building facility. <br>
            In April 2000, KRTC received a contract with TACOM for the supply of the RTCH. As a result, KRTC was awarded three additional contracts for vehicle maintenance, field service support, and aftermarket parts sales. In October 2008, KRTC was awarded a second 5-year contract with the US Department of Defense for manufacturing the RTCH at the Cibolo, Texas facility.<br>
            Today, Kalmarâ€™s 5 building campus consists of a 49,245 square foot manufacturing plant, a 27,206 square foot building for paint, service and repair, a 37,000 square foot parts warehouse, 32,000 square foot Research and Product Development building, and a 30,000 square foot Customer Support Center.</div>
